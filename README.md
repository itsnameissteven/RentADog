# RentADog

RentADog is a fictitious website built to replicate a static comp, a challenge initiated by Turing School of Software and Design, see comp below.  Creative liberties were taken for subject, images, font, icons, color palette, and mobile view. Desktop layout was strictly followed.  Responsive design was built in utilizing CSS grid.
